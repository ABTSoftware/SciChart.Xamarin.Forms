# SciChart.Xamarin.Forms

*EXPERIMENTAL* 

This repository was created as a proof of concept that SciChart can be used in Xamarin.Forms with custom renderers for iOS, Android and WPF. 

We've only mapped a few types, such as the SciChartSurface, one axis type and one series and one DataSeries. Not all properties of the above are fully mapped. 

This project is currently paused as we continue to develop our WPF/iOS/Android charts, including bringing 3D Charts to mobile soon, and feasibiltity in porting to Mac. Once we have got a few of those projects out the way, we will come back to this in earnest :)
